Its bezel-less MicroLED display offers up to 55% transparency when its pixels are set to black or turned off. The display becomes less and less see-through as its pixels light up. Due to technical challenges, the laptop's display resolution is only 720p and it is not currently possible to manually set the whole laptop screen to be opaque. The laptop has a flat touch keyboard as its base that is also designed to work as a drawing tablet. Pictures of the device are available in the article.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Uniswap put out a proposal to modify the governance of its DEX, including adjusting the fee structure to benefit users who delegate and stake their UNI tokens. The proposal will be put to a vote on March 1, followed by an on-chain vote on March 8. This was a huge shift for Uniswap and for governance tokens in general, as very few tokens actually allow holders to participate in the revenues of the protocol. Many are speculating that this indicates positive regulatory progress in the background and could lead to more protocols choosing to include token holders in fee-sharing mechanisms.]]></description>
